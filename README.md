# William Bell

Original science nerd turned tech geek. I graduated from Case Western Reserve's Master of Anesthesia program in 2012. I was fortunate enough to be asked to teach in the program immediately following my tenure as a student.

I went on to be a Clinical, and, Simulation Instructor for the subsequent 6 years. There we utilized sophisticated technology to simulate real time medical emergencies, taking a hands-on approach to training prospective anesthesia providers.

Fascinated with the technological sophistication of our simulator lab, I began seeking further education in the tech realm. Given an opportunity to be involved in a consulting startup specializing in anesthesia education program development, I started as a User Experience (UX) Designer.

From UX, I went on to learn the fundamentals of front-end development. Nowadays, Iâ€™m looking to broaden my programming skillset at [Upstream Coding](https://www.upstreamcoding.com).
